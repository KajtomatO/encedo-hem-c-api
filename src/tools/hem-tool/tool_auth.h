/*
 * tool_auth.h — the ONE login chokepoint for every bearer-needing hem-tool
 * subcommand: passphrase vs mobile push confirmation (--mobile).
 *
 * implements: REQ-TOOL-018
 *
 * Mode selection: `mobile` wins over a passphrase from the ENVIRONMENT
 * (hem.env is commonly auto-sourced); the explicit `--mobile --passphrase`
 * conflict is a usage error rejected by main.c's argument parsing before
 * this helper ever runs. Neither credential → EHEM_ERR_ARG with a message
 * on `err` (callers map it to their USAGE exit).
 *
 * Mobile outcomes: the push happens at the FIRST bearer acquisition (the
 * SDK's lazy ensure-token), so rejected/timeout surface on the command's
 * OPERATION, not on login. Commands route their operation-failure exits
 * through hem_tool_auth_exit() so those outcomes keep ONE tool-wide exit
 * vocabulary on every subcommand (13/14 — above every per-command code;
 * `ext login` keeps its older documented 3/4/5). "Nothing paired" is NOT
 * separately detectable in pure mobile mode — the push goes to nobody and
 * the confirm expires (user decision 2026-08-06: timeout + hint, no
 * pre-check) — so the timeout message points at `hem-tool ext list`.
