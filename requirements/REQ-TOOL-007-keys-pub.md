# hem-tool keys pub — print a key's public material and typed metadata

hem-tool SHALL provide a `keys pub <kid>` subcommand that fetches the key
via `ehem_key_get` (REQ-KEY-003) and prints a human-readable summary —
the device type string, the REQ-KEY-006 classification (family, ExDSA/ECDH
modes), the update timestamp, and the public material (`pubkey` or `der`)
as padded base64 — with output options: `--hex` renders the material as
lowercase hex instead, `--raw` writes the raw material bytes alone to
stdout (pipeline-friendly; all prose suppressed). A symmetric key (no
material on the wire) prints its metadata with an explicit "no public
material" note and still exits 0 — the get succeeded.

The subcommand is strictly read-only. Connection and credentials follow
the existing tool conventions (`EHEM_URL`/`--url`,
`EHEM_PASSPHRASE`/`--passphrase`); exit 0 on success, 2 on
usage/environment errors (missing/malformed kid, missing URL or
passphrase, conflicting format flags), 1 on runtime failure (auth, scope,
key not found, device/network) with an actionable message. The formatting
logic lives in `hem-tool-core` (shared with the unit tests, like the
other subcommands).

**Rationale:** user decision at M4 decomposition (2026-07-16). Makes the
M3/M4 public-key-read path (HEM-SDK-5) drivable by hand — the operator's
way to grab a pubkey for local verification, and living documentation for
`ehem_key_get` + the REQ-KEY-006 classifier. `--raw` exists so the M4
gate demo can pipe device material straight into local tooling.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Against the fake transport: an asymmetric fixture key prints type,
      classified family/modes, updated timestamp, and base64 material;
      `--hex` switches the encoding; `--raw` emits exactly the material
      bytes and nothing else (unit tests on the hem-tool-core function).
      — test_keys_pub: test_pub_asymmetric_b64 / _hex_and_flag_set /
      _raw_bytes_only (raw = exactly 4 bytes, no newline).
- [x] A CERT/DER_PKEY fixture prints its `der` material; a symmetric
      fixture prints metadata + "no public material", exit 0 (unit tests).
      — test_pub_cert_der, test_pub_symmetric_no_material (incl. raw →
      empty stdout, exit 0).
- [x] Malformed/missing kid or missing URL/passphrase → exit 2 with usage,
      no I/O; key not found (device 406) → exit 1 with a message naming
      the kid; read-only — no request besides auth + get (unit tests
      asserting the request sequence). — test_pub_usage_errors_no_io
      (0 requests), test_pub_not_found, 3-request assert in
      test_pub_asymmetric_b64.
- [x] Live (M4 gate): `keys pub` of an `EHEMTEST` ED25519 key prints its
      32-byte pubkey; `--raw` output feeds the local verify in the gate
      demo (manual/integration). — M4 demo 2026-07-16: EHEMTEST ED25519 +
      SECP256R1 keys; `keys pub --raw` → 32/33(compressed) bytes piped
      into SPKI assembly and verified with OpenSSL against `hem-tool
      sign` output (independent of the SDK's own shim); also exercised on
      the device's CURVE25519 authenticator key and CERT chain (--hex).
